<p>
In the directory
<a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/jakarta/commons/daemon/binaries/">binaries</a>
you found subdirectories containing executables
corresponding to your operating system. If your machine is not in the list
mail us we will try to make it available or try to build it on your own.
The files are compressed tar files. They are named jvm_name-os_name.
For example: In the directory freebsd we have jdk1.4.1-FreeBSD_4.9.tar.gz
That a file build on FreeBSD 4.9 using the FreeBSD JVM 1.4.1.

You have to do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Find the nearest tar file corresponding to our configuration.</li>
  <li>Download it.</li>
  <li>Uncompress the tar file and extract it (better with a gnu tar).</li>
  <li>Copy the executable in the location where you want to run it.</li>
  <li>Write a rc shell
     (see in src/samples and src/native/unix/native/Tomcat.sh)
     to get your java application started as a daemon.
  </li>
</ul>
